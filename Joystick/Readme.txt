To load the appropriate Joystick USB descriptors and code, the files in the Library folder must be used to overwrite the files at: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\hardware\teensy\avr\cores\teensy3\
It is recommended to make a backup of the original files before overwriting them

In the Arduino IDE:
Select the Board (under Tools menu) as Teensy 3.x (replace x with appropriate version)
Select the USB Type (under Tools menu) as Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick
